        <p>Butter Chicken, also known as Chicken Makhani, is a classic Indian dish that is made by simmering marinated and grilled chicken(Tandoori chicken) in a spicy, aromatic, buttery and creamy tomato gravy. This dish is hugely famous among the Indian food lovers all across the world.</p>

    <div class="ingredients">
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Tomatoes!</strong> Fresh ripe and pulpy/meaty tomatoes are best for this recipe.
        However you may use 1 cup (8 oz) passata or canned tomato puree. Avoid using sour, tangy tomatoes.
        </li>

        <br>

        <li><strong>Cashews</strong> impart a delicate flavor and act as a thickener. It gives that rich, smooth and silky richness to the sauce.
        You can use almonds or almond flour as a substitute but the taste may vary. To use almonds, soak them in hot water for 2 hours, peel and grind
        to a smooth paste/puree. If using almond flour, grind it with water to a smooth paste.
        </li>

        <br>

        <li><strong>Garam Masala</strong> is a spice blend used in Indian cooking. To make a good butter chicken you need a really good garam masala 
        else your dish can end up being bland without flavors. But be sure to use an aromatic masala and adjust quantity.
        </li>

        <br>

        <li><strong>Kashmiri Red Chilli Powder</strong> is pure Indian chilli powder (ground dried red chillies). It is a medium hot chilli powder which also imparts
        brighter color to your dish. You may substitute it with Byadgi chilli powder or a mix of smoked paprika and cayenne pepper (1:1).
        </li>

        <br>

        <li><strong>Coriander and cumin powder</strong> to add some extra flavor.
        </li>

        <br>
        
        <li><strong>Kasturi Methi</strong> is dried fenugreek leaves. There is no substitute for this and you may leave it out if you do not have it, but adding it is recommended.
        </li>

        <br>

        <li><strong>Greek yogurt/Hung curd.</strong>  Marinade requires thick straineds yogurt like hung curd or greek yogurt. Using regular will easily let out too much moisture while 
        grilling the chicken and all the spice marinade goes over to the pan. This makes your chicken taste bland.
        </li>

        <h1>Stepwise Guide!</h1>
        <ol>
        <li>If using bone-in chicken thighs, make 2 to 3 deep gashes in the chicken; skip this if you use the boneless pieces.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place all the ingredients for the marinade in a medium bowl or ziptop bag and combine until smooth. Fold in the chicken and make sure the chicken is completely coated with the marinade. Leave in the refrigerator covered for 1 hour, preferably overnight.</li>
        <br>
        <li>When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 400F/200C.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Lay the marinated chicken pieces out on a baking dish or roasting pan. Roast the chicken in the oven until the internal temperature reaches 164F/74C, 30 to 45 minutes (boneless chicken takes about 20 minutes), rotating the dish halfway through during cooking. Transfer the baking dish to the upper rack of the oven, and then broil over high for 2 to 4 minutes, until the chicken starts to char in a few spots. Remove the baking dish from the oven.</li>
        <br>
        <li>At the 20-minute mark of cooking the chicken, start the sauce. Melt the butter in a medium Dutch oven or saucepan over low heat. Once the butter begins to foam, stir in the oil. Add the Kashmiri chilli powder, toasted cumin, garlic, ginger, garam masala, and green chilli. Stir until fragrant, 30 to 45 seconds. Then add the tomato paste and cook until the paste begins to turn light brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Pour in the heavy cream and add the chicken and any liquids left behind in the baking dish. Fold to coat well. Stir in the lemon juice, taste, and season with salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high; the fat should separate from the sauce. Remove from the heat. Garnish with cilantro and salted butter if using. Serve hot or warm with rice or naan. Leftovers will stay good for up to 3 days if stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator.</li>
